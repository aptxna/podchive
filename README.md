## Motivation

I don't pay for mobile data on my smartphone.
I also prefer to use my old MP3 player instead of my smartphone for playing music and podcasts in my car.
It has a longer battery life, and I won't add to the wear and tear on my smartphone's headphone jack by frequently plugging and unplugging the aux cable.
This results in the need for me to download the audio files for the music or podcasts I enjoy and transfer them to my player.
Unfortunately, this task has become tedious for podcasts.
Some podcast providers don't appear to make it easy to acquire the actual audio files for their shows.
Even if they do offer a download option, downloading a bunch of them requires navigating to each episode's page on the podcast's website, pressing the download button, waiting a minute, and then navigating to the next episode's page.
In other words, they don't offer an easy way to download all of their episodes.

I can understand why they don't offer this option: these podcast producers would like to gather statistics on how many listeners they have and which of their eposides are the most popular.
Additionally, they don't want a new listener to consume 10 GB of bandwidth in downloading their entire catalog only to have him/her lose interest after listening to a few episodes.

Regardless of their reasoning, I'm creating this project to make it easier to download every episode of a specified postcase to the user's local drive.
I recommend that people who intend on using this project only download those posdcasts that you have a confirmed interest in.
Don't waste a their bandwidth, as they might shut off their downloading option entirely.

#### Why Go?

I wanted to learn Go.
I might abandon Go if it becomes too much of a pain in the ass to develop in, at which point I would port the project to Python.
